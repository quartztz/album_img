# album\_img: a somewhat overcomplicated app for a somewhat simple job.

as the description implies.

to run, use the run executable. 

to stop, exit the application, then close the existing python3 processes. i should really find a way to stop them myself, sorry. 

## TODOS

 - [ ] find a way to kill the python processes on exit.
 - [ ] make it less complicated.
